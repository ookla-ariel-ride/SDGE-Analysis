"""Tie the report's chart arrays to the committed artifacts.

index.html hard-codes its chart series in a `const D = {...}` block rather than
fetching them, which is right for a single self-contained file but means the
numbers can drift from the artifacts that justify them. They did: after the
2026-07-27 interval correction the periods chart carried corrected kWh beside
pre-correction dollars, and nothing failed.

These cases fail instead. They need no private data, only the two committed files.
